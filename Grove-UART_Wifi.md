Grove - UART WiFi is a serial transceiver module featuring the ubiquitous ESP8266 IoT SoC. With integrated TCP/IP protocol stack, this module lets your micro-controller interact with WiFi networks with only a few lines of code. Each ESP8266 module comes pre-programmed with an AT command set firmware, meaning you can send simple text commands to control the device. The SoC features integrated WEP, WPA/WPA2, TKIP, AES, and WAPI engines, can act as an access point with DHCP, can join existing WiFi networks and has configurable MAC and IP addresses.

## Features

* Dimensions: 25.43mm x 20.35mm

##Ultra-low power technology

The ESP8266 was designed to achieve very low energy consumption with patented power management technology that reduces non-essential functions and regulates sleep patterns. There are five power states:

* OFF
* DEEP_SLEEP - the real-time clock runs but all other parts of the chip are closed
* SLEEP - consumes less than 12uA with only real-time clock and watchdog running. The chip will wake on MAC, host, RTC or external interrupt.
* WAKEUP - the system is changing from a sleep to on state. Crystal oscillator and PLL are enabled.
* ON - consumes less than 1.0mW (DTIM = 3) or 0.5mW (DTIM = 10).

The Real-time clock can be programmed to wake the ESP8266 within a specified period of time.

The higher the DTIM period, the longer the device may sleep and therefore the more power the device may potentially save.

To meet the power requirements of mobile applications and wearable electronics, to reduce the overall power consumption, the PA output power can be customised in the firmware.



##Application Ideas

* Sensor networks
* Mesh networking
* Wearable electronics
* Baby monitor
* Network camera
* Industrial wireless control
* WiFi beacons
* Smart power plug
* Location-aware applications

##Getting Started

After this section, you can make **Grove - UART WiFi** run with only few steps.

###Preparations

Now we are making a demo for wireless access point(AP) scan which require following modules.

* [Grove - OLED Display 1.12](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-OLED-Display-112-p-781.html?cPath=34_36)

If this is your first time using [Seeeduino Lite](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Seeeduino-Lite-p-1487.html?cPath=6_7), please refer to [Seeeduino Lite's wiki](https://seeeddoc.github.io/Seeeduino_Lite)

Seeeduino Lite is compatible with Arduino which works as simple as Arduino.

If this is your first time using Arduino, Please put hand on [here](http://arduino.cc) to start your Arduino journey.

###Connecting hardware

[Seeeduino Lite](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Seeeduino-Lite-p-1487.html?cPath=6_7) got Grove socket for connecting two module mentioned above: Grove - [OLED Display 1.12](https://seeeddoc.github.io/Grove-OLED_Display_1.12inch) and [Grove - Uart Wi-Fi](https://seeeddoc.github.io/Grove-UART_WiFi).

They are:

* Grove - OLED Display 1.12 - connection to I2C socket
* Grove - UART Wifi - connection to Serial socket
